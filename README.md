### Credits

I want to thank these projects that gave me an opportunity to build my web site.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the site’s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more. It is a wonderful project which is maintained by volunteers.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just push the changes and the site will be automatically generated.

Some of the sites that I find useful while I'm working on this project. [Links page](https://jekyll-theme-mrgreen-demo.mrgreensworkshop.com/tabs/links.html).
